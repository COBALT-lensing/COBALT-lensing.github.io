Daniela Huppenkothen is a tenure-track staff scientist and NWO WISE fellow at the SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research. Previously, she was Associate Director of the Center for Data-Intensive Research in Astrophysics and Cosmology (DIRAC) at the University of Washington. Before that, she spent time at New York University as a Moore-Sloan Data Science Postdoctoral Fellow, after receiving her PhD at the University of Amsterdam in Astronomy in 2014.
Daniela is interested in leveraging new statistical and computational methods to improve inference within astronomy and space science. Her current research focuses mostly on time series analysis across all parts of astronomy, including asteroids, neutron stars and black holes. She is interested in how we can use machine learning and statistics to mitigate biases introduced into our data by detectors and telescopes. She is co-lead developer of the open-source software project Stingray, which implements a collection of commonly used time series methods in astronomy. When not doing research or writing code, she is interested in finding new ways to teach data science to astronomers (often with candy), and she develops new strategies for facilitating interdisciplinary collaborations in her role as co-organizer of Astro Hack Week.
