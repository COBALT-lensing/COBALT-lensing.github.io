## What is self-lensing?

Lensing comes in all shapes and sizes but in all cases rests on the principle of curved paths of light (geodesics) in curved space-time. Over the preceding decades, a number of surveys (notbly by OGLE) have detected large numbers of micro-lensing events associated with foreground lenses passing in front of background stars in the Magellanic clouds and Galactic bulge. 

Similar in nature but harder to detect is self-lensing which occurs in a binary system. When the compact object (white dwarf, neutron star or black hole - or something even more exotic) passes in front of the normal star then lensing of the light occurs.
