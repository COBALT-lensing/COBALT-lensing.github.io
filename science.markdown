## What is self-lensing?

Lensing comes in all shapes and sizes but in all cases rests on the principle of curved paths of light (geodesics) in curved space-time. Over the preceding decades, a number of surveys (notably by OGLE) have detected large numbers of micro-lensing events associated with foreground lenses passing in front of background stars in the Magellanic clouds and Galactic bulge. 

Similar in nature but harder to detect is self-lensing which occurs in a binary system. When the compact object (white dwarf, neutron star or black hole - or something even more exotic) passes in front of the normal star then lensing of the light occurs. 

Self-lensing has been located in three white dwarf systems to date. The hunt is now on to find the neutron stars and black holes.

# The maths

As described across several seminal papers, the self-lensing signal depends on some key characteristics of the system, notably the masses of the star and lens, radius of the source star, binary separation, impact parameter and limb darkening.
