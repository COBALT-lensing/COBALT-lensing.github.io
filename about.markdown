COBALT is a team of physicists interested in locating compact objects through gravitational lensing phenomena. The project led by Dr Matthew Middleton will use the largest optical surveys to search for signature events caused by self-lensing. These events provide access to the mass of the compact object and will be modelled using cutting-edge codes developed by members of the Consortium (M. Taylor & C. Woodward) to access the spin. All codes will be made public and hosted here. Microlensing events and other interesting phenomena located in the seach will also be posted. Stay tuned.
